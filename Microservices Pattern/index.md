Microservices Pattern :
The collection of small services that are combined to form the actual application is the concept of microservices pattern. Instead of building a bigger application, small programs are built for every service (function) of an application independently. And those small programs are bundled together to be a full-fledged application.  

So adding new features and modifying existing microservices without affecting other microservices are no longer a challenge when an application is built in a microservices pattern.  

Modules in the application of microservices patterns are loosely coupled. So they are easily understandable, modifiable and scalable.  

Example Netflix is one of the most popular examples of software built-in microservices architecture. This pattern is most suitable for websites and web apps having small components.
