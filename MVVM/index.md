Model — View — ViewModel (MVVM) is the industry-recognized software architecture pattern that overcomes all drawbacks of MVP and MVC design patterns. MVVM suggests separating the data presentation logic(Views or UI) from the core business logic part of the application. 
The separate code layers of MVVM are:
Model: This layer is responsible for the abstraction of the data sources. Model and ViewModel work together to get and save the data.
View: The purpose of this layer is to inform the ViewModel about the user’s action. This layer observes the ViewModel and does not contain any kind of application logic.
ViewModel: It exposes those data streams which are relevant to the View. Moreover, it serves as a link between the Model and the View.
